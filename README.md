# Life Notes
This is a Wordpress theme used in my personal website https://obedparla.com.

This theme was my first ever introduction and real work with CSS and Wordpress, so a lot of the 
code is very junior-ish. I'm slowly upgrading the code, specially the CSS.

## Licenses
This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.

life-notes is based on Underscores http://underscores.me/.

This theme was initially created following a great video tutorial by Morten i Norge [@mor10]
